# 🌊 Gabriel

Hey there! I'm Gabriel, a 17 year old software engineer. I love to absorb things around me and to build things of my own. I am a highly ambitious and passionate individual.

# 📂 Portfolio

Here are my 5 projects that I love the most:

* **🐲 gwydion:** a programming language & compiler to LLVM made in Kotlin.
* **👁️ iris:** a live messaging service built in Rust and Svelte.
* **♟️ caissa:** a chess AI + website made in Rust and Svelte.
* **♣️ clubs:** a nice and extremely flexible & multiplatform Kotlin command framework _(archived)_
* **🃏 deck:** wrapper for the Guilded API made in Kotlin _(archived)_

# 🧰 Toolbox

My favourite technologies/tools:

* **Programming language:** 🧱 Rust. The syntax is perfect, trait systems is very logical and concise, performance is good and the equilibrium between low-level and high-level programming is ideal.
* **Web framework:** ❓ Svelte. Simple yet effective, without virtually all of React's nonsense.
* **Virtual Machine:** 🐉 LLVM. I like the LLVM IR and the VM itself, although I'm still learning!
* **Relational: database:** 🐘 PostgreSQL. Solid and has a big community
* **Graph database:** 📊 Neo4j. Found it very entertaining and refreshing

Some of the technologies/tools I found amusing enough to highlight them here, in my profile page (honourable mentions:

* **Programming languages:** 🔀 Kotlin, ☕ Java, 🐍 Python
* **Web frameworks:** 💫 AstroJS and ▶ NextJS
* **Relational database:** 🐬 MySQL
* **Others:** 🎨 CSS, 🪐 Jupyter

Proficiency for the sake of it:

* **Programming languages:** 🗃️ TypeScript and 🌐 JavaScript
* **Web frameworks:** ⚛️ ReactJS
* **Virtual Machine:** 📻 JVM
* **Markup languages:** 🕸️ HTML

# 📋 Additional Interests

Aside from programming, here are some other interests and passions of mine:

* **⚽ Football:** follow it religiously, supporter of Cruzeiro & Real Madrid
* **🔱 Mythology:** most of my projects are named after mythological deities
* **🗽 Philosophy:** constantly on my mind, combined with a natural passion and affinity for it
* **📐 Math:** stimulates me to do associations and teaches me a new way of understanding my surroundings
* **𝚿 Psychology:** vivid enthusiast of human nature, love theorizing and applying its concepts
